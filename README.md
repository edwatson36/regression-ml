# regression-ml
Repo of e2e scripts and source code for linear, logistic, decision-tree, random forest models. 
Includes general uses as well as specific applications eg: to credit risk scoring.
This repo is a work in progress. Over time, I will continue to refine the codebase and extract reusable components from the notebooks into .py files in the `src/` folder.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Upload/prepare your data in the `data/` folder.
3. Use scripts in the `src/` folder or explore workflows in `notebooks/`.
